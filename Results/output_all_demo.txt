The overlying Nordland Group, which extends from the top of the Utsira Formation to the seafloor, is predominantly shale (Fig. 1), and is expected to provide a caprock with a high threshold pressure, sufficient to seal the site and prevent leakage of the buoyant CO2 fluid over several millennia, i.e. the timescale required to offset climate change (Lindeberg and Bergmo, 2003).

In the nightside ionosphere they showed that precipitating electrons could contribute only ∼25% of the plasma densities observed and that changes in ionospheric densities were much more variable than, and not correlated with, changes in the flux of precipitating electrons (Spenner et al., 1981).
