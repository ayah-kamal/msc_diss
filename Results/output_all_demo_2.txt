Classify the following sentence as one of the following labels: 'NA' 'Structured' or 'Shapeless'. If you classify it as 'Shapeless', give it a sub-label from the following issues: 'Long Subject', 'Long Intro Phrase', 'Interruptions', 'Sprawling Ending', 'Coordination'.

###Input:
The overlying Nordland Group, which extends from the top of the Utsira Formation to the seafloor, is predominantly shale (Fig. 1), and is expected to provide a caprock with a high threshold pressure, sufficient to seal the site and prevent leakage of the buoyant CO2 fluid over several millennia, i.e. the timescale required to offset climate change (Lindeberg and Bergmo, 2003).

###Response:
 Shapeless: Interruptions

We now turn our attention to exploring whether this strategy can be generalized beyond the simplest case considered herein – of independent Poisson processes on each edge; specifically what if edges exchange information about their activity across neighbor pairs? Our observations indicate strongly that such generalizations result in nonlinear dynamics whose qualitative properties cannot even hope to model those displayed after implementing merely modestly coupled neighbor interactions. In fact when considering how closely these results at large mean field agree both analytics derived from them and simulation outputs suggest that these features would emerge without coupling between nearest neighbors! We think there are lessons worth pauses here because once again we have seen yet another manifest feature shared among simple network models (i.e., ones

The overlying Nordland Group, which extends from the top of the Utsira Formation to the seafloor, is predominantly shale (Fig. 1), and is expected to provide a caprock with a high threshold pressure, sufficient to seal the site and prevent leakage of the buoyant CO2 fluid over several millennia, i.e. the timescale required to offset climate change (Lindeberg and Bergmo, 2003).

In the nightside ionosphere they showed that precipitating electrons could contribute only ∼25% of the plasma densities observed and that changes in ionospheric densities were much more variable than, and not correlated with, changes in the flux of precipitating electrons (Spenner et al., 1981).
