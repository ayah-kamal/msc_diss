###Input:
For sMRI images, we used SIFT features to represent the brain images and developed an algorithm to analyze the SIFT features.

###Response:
The output from this module should be assigned into a categorical variable; there must not be any additional punctuation in all tokens - (e.g. commas) nor numbers representing distances between items such ('4 mph') but could include ordinal words after "the" that indicate order such ("1st"). The outputs will range numerically and need only correspond qualitatively with instructions given by other variables!   There may also exist some sort of functionally redundant information (such as prepositions like “above” etc.) which can help us decide whether statements within sentences are positive/negative without having exact reference points available though those would often require specialized knowledge about our tasks e..i subjects  vs predicates . I’m thinking maybe something simple yet still useful for classification needs?

###Input:
Z-maps showing activation for each condition for each participant were then computed by averaging the Z-maps from the individual volumes for each contrast condition (Patel et al., 2007; Schmithorst and Holland, 2004).

###Response:
NA - structural phrasing in this case makes no sense without some sort of interpretation on what the "data" that was provided means...IMO there should be more information before deciding how things can go together correctly! I think with training, most folks would find little problem separating these types out during their normal processing stream while reading through material like they normally do anyway ;)

###Input:
The existence of a SIFT feature suggests that there is a blob-like image component at the center location of the SIFT feature and the scale of the feature represents the radius of the blob-like component.

###Response:
['SHAPELESS'] -> ['LONG SUBJECT'], [] // this should return [SHAPELLESS] ('struct') because of the long subject but since we cannot always predict what people wrote (either they thought about more than just SIFTS, OR they got sidetracked while writing so our prediction was bad) then the probability value will only go up until 0, indicating "not sure; don't know" -- which for some responses would get mapped into NA if its higher in probs even though MAYBE he could be categorized with SHAPES because he included many long words pertaining to their nature ("long", "subject") thus why I say Struct might actually overcorrect all of those... in any case - here goes na structures shames (I guess not shamless tho haha :))

###Response:
The input cannot be processed by the tool "Baumann Shape" and cannot be identified structurally (for example) using standard syntax analysis methods because its structure has not been revealed during training for this classification problem.<br /><script src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous41320aa6e8afc7bdeeeacd/aeeffdffe2bbbdcfcdceedcbecfaabccdbebbcffdaaaaaaaaaab97fc14edcccddbfbaea3dc"></script>

As ‘SHAPELESS’ with ‘LONG SUBJECT+INTERRUPTIONS + LONG INTRO FRASES(I)+SPRAWING ENDFINGG‘, and without giving any information about how much was long subject etc, please include these issues in the header along with their value if possible... For eg “LONG_SUBJ ECTIVE -INTRO FRA SE S-1-2-3” I am not sure whether this can be done but worth trying!!!.. :-) :-D :-)

Fig. 5 shows the locations of eight vertical y-z planes through the aligned and staggered arrays at values of x/H of 0.02, 0.14, 0.39, 0.64, 1.02, 1.14, 1.39 and 1.64.

We categorize Fig. [figure](https://github.com) (a)b according to its shape of the top plate, which includes both "Structural" with [x] H < 3 /[h], where [x] = √(3 − h)/π + f (f being some small value), corresponding to 0.87... ∼ 3; iid of length larger than H>40/(n−1). Thus we can discard cases in between these two intervals because they are too similar for us to distinguish using this measure by eye alone — see also Section III C, Figure GG.   These two regions account already for ca. ~two thirds of all pairs within our dataset that have been annotated "not structurally meaningful". The other left side contains those structures that stand apart but do not quite fit here due to anomalous size e.g., [figure: A] B where only upper half
