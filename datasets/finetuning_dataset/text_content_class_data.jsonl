{"text": "[Content]: In this research, we developed a robust two-layer classifier that can accurately classify normal hearing (NH) from hearing impaired (HI) infants with congenital sensori-neural hearing loss (SNHL) based on their Magnetic Resonance (MR) images.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Sprawling Ending"}
{"text": "[Content]: Unlike traditional methods that examine the intensity of each single voxel, we extracted high-level features to characterize the structural MR images (sMRI) and functional MR images (fMRI).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Others, e.g. the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), were not necessarily expected to play a role in differentiating HI from NH children and provided a new understanding of brain function and of the disorder itself.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Interruptions"}
{"text": "[Content]: These important brain regions provided clues about neuroimaging markers that may be relevant to the future use of functional neuroimaging to guide predictions about speech and language outcomes in HI infants who receive a cochlear implant.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Sprawling Ending"}
{"text": "[Content]: This type of prognostic information could be extremely useful and is currently not available to clinicians by any other means.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: It has been estimated that approximately 1 to 6 infants per 1000 are born with severe to profound congenital sensori-neural hearing loss (SNHL) (Bachmann and Arvedson, 1998; Cunningham and Cox, 2003; Kemper and Downs, 2000; Northern, 1994).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Those children receive little or no benefit from hearing aids and face challenges in developing language abilities due to their inability to detect acoustic-phonetic signals, which are essential for hearing-dependent learning.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Cochlear implantation (CI) is a surgical procedure that inserts an electronic device into the cochlea for direct stimulation of the auditory nerve and has been demonstrated to be effective in restoring hearing in patients suffering from SNHL.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Statistical data from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) indicate that approximately 28,400 children in the United States have received a cochlear implant as of December 2010.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: While many congenitally deaf CI recipients achieve a high degree of accuracy in speech perception and develop near-normal language skills, about 30% of the recipients do not derive any benefit from the CI (Niparko et al., 2010).\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Intro Phrase"}
{"text": "[Content]: A deeper understanding of hearing loss and better characterization of the brain regions affected by hearing loss will help reduce the high variance in CI outcomes and result in a more effective treatment of children with hearing loss.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: In recent years, Magnetic Resonance (MR) images have been used to study neurological disorders and brain development in children, such as reading and attention problems, traumatic brain injury, hearing impairment, perinatal stroke and other conditions (Horowitz-Kraus and Holland, 2012; Leach and Holland, 2010; Smith et al., 2011; Tillema et al., 2008; Tlustos et al., 2011).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Jonas et al. reviewed a total number of 162 patients' structural MRI scans, and detected 51 abnormalities in 49 patients.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Those abnormalities included white matter changes, structural or anatomical abnormalities, neoplasms, gray matter changes, vasculitis and neuro-metabolic changes (Jonas et al., 2012).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Furthermore, functional MRI studies have demonstrated that the activation pattern of HI is different from that of NH during certain scanning tasks (Bilecen et al., 2000; Patel et al., 2007; Propst et al., 2010; Scheffler et al., 1998; Tschopp et al., 2000).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: For example, Propst and colleagues studied the activation pattern of HI with narrowband noise and speech-in-noise tasks (Propst et al., 2010).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: In the narrowband noise task, they found that HI children had weaker activation in the auditory areas when compared to NH children.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: In the speech-in-noise task, HI children activated the secondary auditory processing areas only in the left hemisphere, rather than bilaterally as is typical of NH.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: A strong correlation (linear regression coefficient, R=0.88) was detected between the improvement in post-CI hearing threshold and the amount of activation in the A1 region before CI (Patel et al., 2007).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Despite these recent advances, it remains unclear whether these structural and functional abnormalities are sufficient to distinguish HI from NH individuals.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: In this study, we set out to investigate whether we can accurately classify HI from NH individuals based on MR images alone by utilizing machine learning techniques.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: We have trained three classifiers, one based on structural MR (sMRI) images, another based on functional MR (fMRI) images, and a third that integrates sMRI and fMRI images.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: While traditional methods utilize voxel-based morphometric (VBM) features, in which each single voxel serves as an independent feature, we extracted high-level features to characterize the 3D images.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Intro Phrase"}
{"text": "[Content]: Specifically, we employed the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm to detect and describe local features in sMRI and extracted region-level features to represent the functional contrast maps.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: The set of SIFT features extracted from an image contains important characteristics of this image and can be used for subsequent analysis, e.g. object recognition, gesture recognition etc.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: In this study, we employed the SIFT algorithm to extract SIFT features from brain structural MR images, and devised an approach for the automatic classification of NH vs. HI based on the SIFT features.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Secondly, brain regions identified by the classifiers enable us to better understand hearing loss, and may serve as valuable indicators for the CI outcome and facilitate follow-up treatment post-CI (Jonas et al., 2012).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Finally, our algorithm can be easily extended to assist in diagnosing other disorders affecting children's brains, e.g., speech sound disorders of childhood, leading to a path for improving child health.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: In Materials and methods, we describe in sequence the data sources and the preprocessing procedures, the methods of analyzing sMRI and fMRI images, the integrative model that combines these two methods, and the validation of our classifiers.\n[Classification]: Structured"}

{"text": "[Content]: Finally, in Discussion, we summarize the present work, highlight the significance of our approach, and discuss the limitations and envisioned future improvements.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: We also examine the predictive brain regions our classifiers identified and discuss their relevance in the context of hearing loss.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: All hearing impaired participants were referred by the Division of Otolaryngology for MRI as part of the cochlear implant staging process and consented to participate in our adjoining fMRI protocol.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: They had documented bilateral severe to profound hearing loss with average hearing thresholds in the range of 90dB or greater.\n[Classification]: NA"}

{"text": "[Content]: One of the challenges of research in pediatric neuroimaging is that it is unethical to expose children to more than minimal risk for the purposes of research.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Consequently, one of the fine points in the design of the present study is that we were required to select our control population among infants who were referred for an MRI scan with sedation because of a clinical indication.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Sprawling Ending, Long Subject"}

{"text": "[Content]: Five NBN tones of 1s duration with center frequencies of 250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000Hz and bandwidth of 50% were played in random order during this control condition, for a total of 5s during a silent interval of the scanner.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: An additional interval of 1s of silence followed each acquisition to provide an acoustic demarcation prior to the stimulus onset of each stimulus condition.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Auditory stimuli were administered through calibrated MR compatible headphones at a sound level of 10-15dB greater than the individual participant's Pure Tone Average (PTA) hearing threshold.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Each hearing impaired participant in the study had a recent audiogram, which was used to determine the sound level for fMRI.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: fMRI data were initially analyzed on a voxel-by-voxel basis to identify the activated brain regions using a standard pre-processing pipeline implemented in the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Image Processing Software (CCHIPS) (Schmithorst et al., 2010) written in IDL computer language.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Coordination"}
{"text": "[Content]: Since the subjects were sedated, we assumed that the anatomical image was naturally aligned with the functional images for each individual.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: To generate both normalized contrast maps used in the current study as well as contrast maps in native space for other uses, we first generated contrast maps in each individual's native space and then normalized the contrast maps to standard space.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Intro Phrase"}
{"text": "[Content]: The raw EPI images were simultaneously corrected for Nyquist ghosting and geometrical distortion (due to B0 field inhomogeneity) (Schmithorst et al., 2001).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Finally, the individual image volumes (1,2,3) in the event-related fMRI acquisition were separated and submitted to a final pre-processing step using the General Linear Model (Worsley et al., 2002) to construct individual Z-maps for each volume and contrast condition (speech vs. silence, speech vs. tones and tones vs. silence).\n[Classification]: NA"}

{"text": "[Content]: For sMRI images, we used SIFT features to represent the brain images and developed an algorithm to analyze the SIFT features.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: We have previously applied this method to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and bipolar disease, and it has demonstrated promising classification performance (Chen et al., 2013).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Due to the high density of SIFT features in the brain images and the pair-wise comparison among SIFT features required in a later step, analyzing the 3D brain image as a whole is computationally infeasible.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Intro Phrase, Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: Since the dimensions of brain image were not divisible by 20, the cubes at the end of dimensions only contained the remaining volume of the brain image and therefore had a size smaller than 20\u00c3\u201420\u00c3\u201420.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: The cube size mainly affects the computation speed and accuracy of the likelihood scores as described in the Feature evaluation section below.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: A larger size leads to a much longer computation time, while a smaller size decreases the accuracy of likelihood scores and subsequently leads to lower classification accuracy.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: In this study, we used the SIFT algorithm provided in a publicly available computer vision software package vlFeat (Vedaldi and Fulkerson, 2010).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The existence of a SIFT feature suggests that there is a blob-like image component at the center location of the SIFT feature and the scale of the feature represents the radius of the blob-like component.\n[Classification]: Structured"}

{"text": "[Content]: Cellular morphology, pluripotency gene expression and differentiation into the three germ layers have been used compare the outcomes of manual and automated processes.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) are generated from reprogrammed fibroblasts by overexpression of pluripotency factors (Takahashi et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: These pluripotent cells have the unique characteristic to self renew in vitro while maintaining the capacity to differentiate into a broad number of cell types.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Furthermore, the possibility of generating hiPSC from somatic cells using epigenetic reprogramming represents a unique opportunity for personalized regenerative medicine.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: Indeed, these pluripotent stem cells could enable the production of patient specific cell types that are fully immuno-compatible with the original donor thereby avoiding the need for immune suppressive treatment after cell transplantation.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Sprawling Ending"}
{"text": "[Content]: Nevertheless, the practical, financial and temporal obstacles in producing and validating personalized clinical-grade hiPSC and their differentiated progeny will almost certainly limit the feasibility of this approach.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: The creation of clinical banks of hiPSC from donors that can provide HLA matching to recipients is proposed as a strategy to attenuate the host immune response to transplanted tissue (Lin et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2005, 2011).\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: Similarly, hiPSC can be used to develop in vitro disease models, allowing large scale studies otherwise restricted due to the limited availability of primary cells and biopsy material.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: This application has been proven useful to model neurodegenerative diseases, cardiac syndromes and metabolic disorders in vitro for basic studies and drug screening (Ebert et al., 2009; Moretti et al., 2010; Rashid et al., 2010).\n[Classification]: Structured"}

{"text": "[Content]: Scale up automation enables scale out for conventional formats with predictable process variation and quality outcome by removing manual interventions.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Furthermore, large scale production of hiPSC for clinical applications would require expansion in culture using clinically compatible conditions in a reproducible way without loss of function and in sufficient numbers to create reproducible and cost effective therapeutic products.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject, Coordination"}
{"text": "[Content]: Finally, passaging represent the main difficulty to develop an automation platform to expand hiPSC since these cells must be propagated as aggregates/clumps to maintain their integrity and quality (Beers et al., 2012).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Indeed, evidence indicates that hiPSC grown and harvested as single cells are more likely to acquire genetic anomalies (Amps et al., 2011).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Here, we have addressed all these issues by transferring an established manual method to grow hiPSC in feeder free and chemically defined medium onto an automated platform compatible with large scale production.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: This study shows for the first time that large scale automated production of hiPSC is possible without the need of single cell dissociation thereby respecting their natural properties.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: hiPSC were cultured in feeder-free conditions using chemically defined medium (CDM-PVA) with Activin A (10ngml-1, R&D System) and FGF2 (12ngml-1, R&D Systems) - iPSC medium, as previously described (Brons et al., 2007).\n[Classification]: Structured"}

{"text": "[Content]: A second wash step was performed before colonies were gently broken down into smaller cell aggregates (clumps) by pipetting and allowed to settle under gravity.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: It must be noted here that the aim was only to reduce the size of the aggregates and not to reduce them to single cells.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Cell clumps were plated at 1:10 split ratio to 0.1% porcine gelatin plates (Sigma), pre-coated with mouse embryonic fibroblast medium containing 10% FBS (Biosera) for 24h at 37\u00c2\u00b0C and 5% (v/v) CO2.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: The CompacT SelecT (The Automation Partnership, UK) is a fully automated cell culture platform which incorporates a small six-axis anthropomorphic robotic arm (Cell Therapy Manufacturing Facility, 2011) that can access 90 T175 flask and plate incubators, controlled at 37\u00c2\u00b0C under an atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2 and humidity.\n[Classification]: Structured"}

{"text": "[Content]: At Loughborough University, the CompacT SelecT has been successfully used to culture many different cell types including human mesenchymal cells and human embryonic stem cells (hESC) (Thomas et al., 2007, 2009a,b).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: The CompacT SelecT has also been shown to be successful at preventing contamination when the GMP version of the CompacT SelecT passed the \"sterile fill\" runs (Chandra et al., 2012).\n[Classification]: Structured"}

{"text": "[Content]: In order to transfer the culture protocol to the CompacT SelecT it was necessary to scale up from a T25 to a T175 flask, media volumes were scaled proportionally to flask surface area, and work within the restricted set of plasticware and the allowable positioning of the plasticware within the automated system (Fig. 1).\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Coordination"}
{"text": "[Content]: Operating conditions of the manual culture process were followed as closely as possible (temperature, timing, splitting ratio, mixing, volumes), however a number of detailed changes had to be made to the manual protocol as are discussed later in the manuscript.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: hiPSC were plated into gelatin plates pre coated with 10% FBS and maintained for 24h in iPSC medium before inducing differentiation into the three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm and neuroectoderm as described previously (Vallier et al., 2009).\n[Classification]: Structured"}

{"text": "[Content]: An human induced pluripotent stem cell line - BBHX8 (Vallier et al., 2009), derived from adult human fibroblasts using retroviral reprogramming with OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC was derived and manually maintained at the Anne McLaren Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine (LRM), University of Cambridge.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: In order to develop an automation process to expand hiPSC using CompacT SelecT, the hiPSC line was transferred to the Centre for Biological Engineering (CBE), Loughborough University where it was further cultured and passaged in T25 flasks using the manual protocol established at LRM (Brons et al., 2007).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: When transferring to T175 flasks, two major limitations of the CompacT SelecT were taken into consideration: (i) as an alternative to the use of conical tubes the T175 flask was used to wash and pellet the cell clumps by gravity.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: (ii) 10ml pipettes were used instead of 1000\u00ce\u00bcl tips when breaking the cell clumps to a desirable size (Fig. 2).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Cells were maintained using the manual protocol in both T25 and T175 flasks to show process transfer and scale up within both facilities.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: The manual process of expanding T175 flasks was executed for three weeks to gain confidence in the protocol before cells were transferred to the CompacT SelecT.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: A split ratio of 1:10 was maintained and the cell clumps broken to the appropriate size by the operator using a 10ml pipette (Table 1).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: However it become evident that mimicking the breaking of cell clumps to the desirable size by the operator would be the most difficult step to automate.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: To adapt the T175 manual protocol to the CompacT SelecT, four iterations of the automation protocol were written and tested in the CompacT SelecT.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: The changes made in the four versions of the automated protocol were based on: (a) the time for the colonies to settle down by gravity after washing, (b) the distance of the pipette from the bottom of the flask when removing diluted enzyme solution without aspirating the cells clumps, (c) the pipetting speed and number of mixing steps required to achieve an homogeneous cell suspension of the desirable cell clump size without the presence of an undue number of single cells, and (d) the split ratio (Table 2).\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: To take into account the small volumes of some reagents and to prevent inaccuracies of the dispensed volumes by a 10ml pipette or 1.6mm bore tubing, the media formulation was mixed manually.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Intro Phrase"}
{"text": "[Content]: In the first version (A) of the automated protocol, several cell clumps were lost during the washing steps as the time for cell clumps to settle was insufficient, additionally several clumps were aspirated due to the pipette reaching close to the bottom of the flask when aspirating the enzymatic solution.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Coordination"}
{"text": "[Content]: This was chosen to account for any potential cell loss during the automation steps described in the above paragraph (a)-(c).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: It proved difficult to use the CEDEX cell counter to count clumps of cells in order to passage cells based on cell count as the CEDEX could not count the clumps accurately (data not shown).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: This would have improved process reproducibility, however the methods available for counting cell aggregates/clump are not yet suitable to be integrated within an automation platform.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: While the robot placed the flasks gently in the incubator carousel without disturbing the cells, as soon as the carousel was rotated, cell clumps moved under centrifugal force to concentrate in parts of the flask resulting in a heterogeneous distribution of the cell clumps/colonies in the flask; this in particular can result in the growth of differentiated colonies.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Intro Phrase"}
{"text": "[Content]: This observation showed the importance of leaving the unattached cells in an undisturbed condition and that even the slightest movement can result in a heterogeneous distribution of the colonies.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Coordination"}
{"text": "[Content]: Of the four flasks/protocol versions (A-D) tested in the CompacT SelecT, C was the best protocol based on colony morphology and absence of differentiation 7 days after passage (Fig. 2).\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Intro Phrase"}
{"text": "[Content]: To further assess the quality of these cells when compared to manual protocols (T25Manual and T175Manual), expression of pluripotency markers was analyzed using qPCR and immunochemistry.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Intro Phrase"}
{"text": "[Content]: These analyses showed high levels and homogenous expression of pluripotency markers and morphology characteristic of hiPSC for both manual and automated protocols (Fig. 3).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: In addition, capacity of differentiation toward the three germ layers was confirmed by growing the hiPSC into culture conditions inductive for endoderm, mesoderm and neuroectoderm differentiation.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: Both manual protocols in T25 flasks and the automated protocol in T175 flasks showed homogeneous differentiation of hiPSC into the three germ layers as observed by the change of cell morphology and by the expression of endoderm markers: SOX17 and EOMES, mesoderm markers: BRACHURY and MIXL1 and neuroectoderm markers: NESTIN and SOX2 (Fig. 4).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: These results suggest that cells expanded with our automation protocol retain the capacity to produce cell types with a clinical interest.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Considered together, these data suggest that the transfer of protocols between the two facilities was successful and that both scale-up and automation protocols were shown to maintain cell function comparable to manually passaged hiPSC.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a protocol passaging hiPSC in an automated system, the CompacT SelecT, with cells maintained as aggregates.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The comparison between manual and automated conditions showed the maintenance and passaging of hiPSC is feasible using the CompacT SelecT system, however to improve reproducibility some detailed changes will have to be implemented.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: Further work is necessary to define more accurately the critical protocol parameters and take account of the constraints required when generating fully functional hiPSC lines for clinical applications.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: With respect to future automated solutions incubator design must take into account the current necessity of not disturbing cells that require to be grown as aggregates, such as hiPSC and that take time (potentially up to 24h) to attach.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Automation would most certainly benefit from development of (conical) plastic vessels of the volume necessary to accommodate cell suspensions from T175 flasks as this could reduce the time for cell clumps to settle and thus speeding the passaging protocol.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: The option to use a pipette with smaller bore than a 10ml pipette would assist the optimization of breaking cell clumps to the desirable size and reduce the single cell debris caused by pipetting.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: While these modifications would be required to optimize the present protocol to ensure maximum yields of cells, this study represents a proof of principle that hiPSC can be expanded in clumps using automation without loss of quality.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Intro Phrase"}

{"text": "[Content]: Dispersion in the near-field region of localised releases in urban areas is difficult to predict because of the strong influence of individual buildings.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: As a result, concentration patterns are highly variable in time and mean profiles in the near field are strongly non-Gaussian.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: These aspects of near-field dispersion are documented by analysing data from direct numerical simulations in arrays of building-like obstacles and are related to the underlying flow structure.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The mean flow structure around the buildings is found to exert a strong influence over the dispersion of material in the near field.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Entrainment of material into building wakes in the very near field gives rise to secondary sources, which then affect the subsequent dispersion pattern.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: High levels of concentration fluctuations are also found in this very near field; the fluctuation intensity is of order 2 to 5.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Understanding dispersion processes in urban areas is important for modelling air quality as well as pollution from accidental or terrorist releases.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The chaotic nature of turbulent flow and the complexity of the building geometry both contribute to making such modelling non-trivial.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Urban geometry affects the mean flow and turbulence significantly (Barlow and Coceal, 2009) and thereby exerts a strong control on dispersion processes (Belcher, 2005).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: For localised releases, such effects are particularly important in the near-field region (here defined as within a few building blocks of the release), where conventional models such as Gaussian plume models fail (Belcher et al., 2013).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Recently, Wood et al. (2009) reported above-background dosages within 6-8 times the building height in all directions around the source in field experiments in central London.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The present paper is an attempt to document such near-field aspects for simple urban-like geometries, where their effects can be more easily isolated and therefore better understood.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: These questions are explored by analysing data from the recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) reported in Branford et al. (2011) and new simulations presented here.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: These simulations involve the continuous release of a passive scalar from localised ground-level sources within a regular array of cubes.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Results are presented in Section 3, which first looks at the instantaneous and mean flow field; the scalar field is then explored by looking at the instantaneous and mean concentration patterns, concentration profiles and time series.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: The numerical technique for solving the Navier-Stokes equations in the DNS is described in Yao et al. (2001) and Coceal et al. (2006).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: In brief, the equations are discretized using second-order central finite differences in space and a second-order Adams-Bashforth scheme in time, based on the pressure correction method.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Branford et al. (2011) performed a series of DNS for different wind directions (0\u00c2\u00b0, 30\u00c2\u00b0 and 45\u00c2\u00b0) over a regular array of cubical obstacles of height H.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The domain size was 16H x 16H\u00c3\u201416H in the horizontal and 8H in the vertical - see Fig. 1a and b.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Additionally, we present results for new simulations done for flow at an angle of 45\u00c2\u00b0 over a smaller staggered array of domain size 8H x 8H\u00c3\u20148H x 8H\u00c3\u20148H - see Fig. 1c.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Comparison with simulations over a larger staggered array of domain size 16H x 12H\u00c3\u201412H x 8H\u00c3\u20148H (Coceal et al., 2007) revealed similar turbulence statistics; hence, since the emphasis here is on near-source dispersion, the size of the present domain is adequate.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: The Reynolds number based on the velocity at the top of the domain and the cube height was typically between 4750 and 7000.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: While this is much less than Reynolds numbers at full scale, it is comparable to typical Reynolds numbers achieved in many wind tunnel experiments.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Numerical tests showed that a grid resolution of H/32 was sufficient, producing flow and concentration statistics that agreed with test runs at double the resolution (H/64) to within a few percent (Coceal et al., 2006, Branford et al., 2011).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Based on the wall friction velocity u\u00cf\u201e and the cube dimension H, a non-dimensional time scale characterizing the turnover time of eddies shed from the cubes can be defined as T=H/u\u00cf\u201e.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The simulations were run with a time step of 0.00025T, spun up for a duration of approximately 200T to allow fully developed turbulence conditions and statistics were collected over an interval of approximately 100T.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The simulations for the larger arrays typically took a few weeks in total to run on 124 dual-core 2.5GHz PowerPC 970MP processors.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: In this study we investigate the dispersion of a passive scalar, which is modelled by numerically solving the scalar transport equation using an Eulerian approach.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: A sponge layer is applied to the scalar field around the domain to prevent the scalar from re-entering the domain due to the periodic boundary conditions.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The scalar is released continuously and at a steady rate from an ensemble of point sources close to the ground (at z=0.0625H) within the simulated urban area; the source locations are indicated in Fig. 1.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: The sources in both cases (a) and (b) are placed in equivalent locations, therefore they form an ensemble of equivalent releases and ensemble averaging can be performed to extend the time series of each individual release.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Here the sources are in three different locations: behind a cube (3 equivalent locations), in front of a cube (3 equivalent locations) and in the space between two cubes (1 location).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Near-source dispersion is sensitive to the building geometry and it is therefore impossible to perform a comprehensive study of the influence that specific urban geometrical features have on the dispersion.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Our motivation, therefore, is to gain insight into generic features of the dispersion patterns and how they are influenced by the flow structure in simple commonly-occurring urban setups.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: The choice of these different configurations allows us to look at the effect of wind direction, building layout and source location on dispersion in a simple but plausible setup.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Detailed comparisons of mean concentration profiles at different locations within and above the array showed good agreement with data from a water-channel experiment (Hilderman and Chong, 2007) on the same configuration of cubical buildings, as reported in Branford et al. (2011).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Dispersion within a building array is heavily influenced by the flow structure and how it varies in space and time.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: To form an idea of the instantaneous flow field, Figs. 2 and 3 show wind vector snapshots for the aligned array for the two wind directions of 0\u00c2\u00b0 and 45\u00c2\u00b0 at four different heights, corresponding to values of z/H of 0.23, 0.52, 0.80 and 1.08.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: We adopt a Cartesian coordinate system in which the x coordinate is directed from left to right (along the mean forcing direction for the 0\u00c2\u00b0 case), the y coordinate points upwards and along the plane of the paper and the z coordinate points vertically out of the paper.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: The corresponding instantaneous velocity components are u, v and w, with mean components denoted by U, V and W and fluctuating components denoted by u\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2, v\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 and w\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 respectively.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Broadly speaking, two main flow patterns can be discerned in these plots: a recirculation in the wake region behind the cubes with generally low velocity and a faster channelling flow along the unobstructed channels between alternate rows of cubes.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: However, on an instantaneous basis, the flow in these channels is far from being linear along the direction of the forcing.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: A consequence of the highly unsteady character of the turbulent flow in this complex geometry is that individual flow realisations may behave in somewhat unintuitive ways.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: For example, at z=0.23H there is a swirling motion in the intersection region which drives faster fluid at an angle into the downstream section of the upper channel (Fig. 2a).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Elsewhere, for example in the upstream section of the lower channel at z=0.52H (Fig. 2b), much of the flow diverts into the side 'street' behind the building wake instead of proceeding downstream along the channel as one might expect.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Such intermittent flow features drive turbulent exchanges between the channels along the forcing direction and the 'streets' perpendicular to it.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Further up at z=0.80H (Fig. 2c) the flow pattern along the lower channel meanders between the alternate rows of buildings.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The array is laterally symmetric with respect to the flow direction of 45\u00c2\u00b0, but at any particular instant, the actual flow pattern is non-symmetrical.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: For example, at z=0.23H there is a recirculation behind the eastward face of the cube on the lower left but none on the northward face.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Above the array at 1.08H, the flow is broadly in the direction of the forcing on average, but there are strong deviations associated with flow around the cube tops.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Similar observations on the asymmetry and unsteadiness of the instantaneous flow patterns can be made for the staggered array (not shown).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The time-averaged flow structure in the aligned array for the two forcing directions of 0\u00c2\u00b0 and 45\u00c2\u00b0 and in the staggered array for 45\u00c2\u00b0 are shown in Fig. 4.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The implicit averaging over many instantaneous realisations has removed much of the small scale complexity in the flow pattern and emphasized the two main features identified earlier, namely large recirculations within the 'canyon' region behind the buildings and a channelling flow in the open 'street' region between the rows of cubes.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The streamlines within this channelling region appear much more linear now and look similar at the two heights within the array.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: In contrast, the structure of the recirculations changes with height, indicating that the building wake has a three-dimensional structure (Goulart, 2012).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: There is a recirculation behind each face of the cubes, symmetrically disposed with respect to the 45\u00c2\u00b0 diagonal line through the cubes.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Streamlines from the two perpendicular streets upstream of the intersection come together and then diverge around the corner of the next building at the intersection, part of them feeding into a recirculation on the leeward face of the upstream buildings in the street perpendicular to the original flow direction and another part channelling into the far side of that same street.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Firstly, the diverging streamlines around the building corner lead to considerable mean transport into lateral streets and thereby enhance horizontal (lateral) dispersion, a process known as 'topological dispersion' (Davidson et al., 1995, Belcher, 2005).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Secondly, the recirculations trap material and release them on a slower timescale (Vincent, 1978) higher up and into the flow above the array.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The relative roles of the recirculations and the channelling flow change with increasing height, as the recirculations reduce in size, coupled with stronger mean flow into the side streets.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Staggering the cube rows in the streamwise direction means that the flow is no longer symmetrical with respect to the 45\u00c2\u00b0 diagonal line through the array.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: This asymmetry modifies the details of the flow topology drastically, but broadly similar structural elements can be identified as in the aligned array.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: There are now two recirculations behind one leeward face of the cube and a smaller one on the other leeward face.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The streamlines still diverge around the cubes, but now do so around a cube face rather than around a corner.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: As for the aligned array, the recirculations are weaker and the channelling flow is stronger in the gaps further up.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Given that the flow field is three-dimensional, particularly when the flow direction is oblique, it is instructive to look at its structure in a vertical plane.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Fig. 5 shows the locations of eight vertical y-z planes through the aligned and staggered arrays at values of x/H of 0.02, 0.14, 0.39, 0.64, 1.02, 1.14, 1.39 and 1.64.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Fig. 6 shows a sequence of mean wind vector plots in these vertical planes for the aligned array for 45\u00c2\u00b0 flow.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Also, due to symmetry about the 45\u00c2\u00b0 axis, the same pattern applies to the (u, w) wind vectors in corresponding x-z planes.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 At x=0.02H (close to the entry into the 'street', Fig. 6a), there is a strong flow component towards the downstream side of the street canyon.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 At x=0.14H (a little further into the canyon, Fig. 6b), we start seeing a weak updraft up the leeward face of the buildings.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 At x=0.39H (almost halfway into the canyon, Fig. 6c), there is a recirculation with an associated strong updraft along the leeward face.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 At x=0.64 H (about two-third of the way into the street, Fig. 6d), a similar picture applies, but the core of the vortex is further up and there is now a strong flow in the lower part of the canyon towards the lee of the building.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: This would cause any material in the street canyon (which, for example, might have come from advection along the street from upstream) to be driven into the recirculation region.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 At x=1.02H (into the long street region and close to the face of a cube, Fig. 6e), an updraft inclined at some angle can be seen over most of the building's face.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 At x=1.14H (a little further into the long street, Fig. 6f), there is still a strong updraft over most of the leeward face of the cube, now almost straight upward, whereas the vortex is still present but with its core a little lower down.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 At x=1.39H (almost halfway into the street, Fig. 6g), there is now a strong flow along the street, but an upward displacement of the flow in the intersection region.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 At x=1.64H (closer to the face of the downstream buildings, Fig. 6h), advection along the street predominates, with a weaker upward flow close to the downstream cube.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Qualitatively similar flow features are observed for 45\u00c2\u00b0 flow in the staggered array (Fig. 7), except in the last two vertical planes at x=1.39H and x=1.64H, where the presence of a building at the end of the street at x=2H (see Fig. 5b) gives rise to a reverse flow region in the middle part of the plane shown.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Subject"}
{"text": "[Content]: A key three-dimensional characteristic of the flow is the strong updraft up the leeward face of the buildings due to the recirculating vortex in the building wake.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: This is a manifestation of the 'chimney effect' observed especially in the vicinity of tall buildings (see e.g. Heist et al., 2009).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Having surveyed the structure of the flow field, we now move on to consider its effect on the resulting concentration patterns and dispersion characteristics.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Figs. 8 and 9 show snapshots of the concentration field for the aligned array for the two wind directions of 0\u00c2\u00b0 and 45\u00c2\u00b0 at four different heights, corresponding to values of z/H of 0.23, 0.52, 0.80 and 1.08.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: In these plots the plume is represented using 'smoke' visualisation and with the regions of highest concentration indicated by contour lines.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Focusing first on the 0\u00c2\u00b0 case (Fig. 8), in which the release is close to the ground (at z=0.0625 H) in the middle of the gap between the two middle cubes, it is clear that much of the material is captured in the wake region behind the upstream cube.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Long Intro Phrase"}
{"text": "[Content]: Due to this trapping and the fact that the mean flow in the adjacent channels is at 0\u00c2\u00b0 (see Fig. 4c and d), the lateral spread of the plume is rather limited.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: In this snapshot, at z=0.23H the whole plume is blown into the canyon region between the cubes in the y-direction and none in the x-direction.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: In a different snapshot this might of course be different and on average the plume would be equally likely to be blown into the gap in the x-direction.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: A little further up, at z=0.52H, we see that much of the material is now caught in the wake region.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The highest concentration is around the centre of the gap, but somewhat away from the mean location of the core of the recirculation behind the upstream cube.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: These visualisations suggest the idea that transfer from the original source location to the wake occurs predominantly at low levels, whereas the re-release of material occurs mainly at higher levels.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: This spatial asymmetry results in a plume that tends to fluctuate in a preferential direction and causes more material to accumulate in the wake of particular buildings in the immediate vicinity of the source; this is examined in the next section.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Fig. 10 shows contour plots of the mean concentration at two different heights z=0.23H and z=0.98H for 0\u00c2\u00b0 and 45\u00c2\u00b0 flow over the aligned array.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: These result from the integration of the instantaneous concentration distribution over a total duration of 100T, where T is an eddy turnover time.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: In Fig. 10a and b (which show results for the 0\u00c2\u00b0 case) the flow is perpendicular to the faces of the cubes.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: As discussed earlier, the concentration pattern results from the trapping of material into the wake of the building immediately upstream of the source, and the escape of material into the channels on either side, which is then swept downstream in the fast flow in the channel.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Some of that material enters the wake regions of the cubes downstream, but this represents a much smaller fraction compared to that entrained into the wake of the first cube.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: This is not surprising; as the plume becomes more distributed, there is less material left to be trapped in subsequent wakes.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: It is most significant in the immediate vicinity of the release, where the plume is concentrated in a small region of space.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: In the lower part of the array (z=0.23 H), a lateral profile of concentration at most locations downstream would show a bimodal distribution (not shown), due to the bifurcation of the plume around the obstacles.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Near the array top (z=0.98 H), this is less so, presumably because material can flow over the cube tops and then be re-entrained into the region below the cube tops.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: But this division of the plume is accentuated by the effect of the two secondary sources in the wakes of the two cubes immediately downstream of the source.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Indeed, as Fig. 10c shows, material from the source in the intersection rapidly spreads into these wakes in the lower part of the array (here shown for z=0.23H) and this trapped material is released further up (here shown at z=0.98H, Fig. 10d), effectively giving two overlapping plumes originating from the two secondary sources.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: The combined effect of these secondary sources and the topological dispersion around the cubes contribute to making the plume wider than that in the 0\u00c2\u00b0 case.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The mean concentration pattern is plotted at two different heights (z=0.23H and z=0.98H) when the source is directly downstream of a cube in the x direction (Fig. 11a and b), directly upstream of a cube (Fig. 11c and d) and in the channel between two cubes (Fig. 11e and f).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: In the first and second cases material is drawn back into the recirculation behind the upstream cube(s) (Fig. 11a and c); in the third case, it is first swept forward along the channel and thereafter entrained into the building wakes upstream (Fig. 11e).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Further up, the material is released and appears to originate from secondary sources in the respective building wakes (Fig. 11b,d and f).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: In this case, the secondary sources are not symmetrical like the aligned array due to the asymmetry of the flow pattern, so that one of the secondary sources is predominant (Goulart, 2012).\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: This is illustrated here for the 45\u00c2\u00b0 aligned array case by looking at lateral profiles of concentration just above the array (at z=1.02H) at different distances from the original source (Fig. 12).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: In this plot and in the text below horizontal distances are given in a coordinate system along the mean plume direction (x') and perpendicular to it (y').\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: There is a central peak associated with material coming directly from the original source, but there are also two stronger peaks on either side associated with the secondary sources.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: There are two other, smaller, peaks on either side of the centre with a mean concentration about a third of that of the central peak.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Fitting a triple Gaussian to the concentration profile captures the central part of the plume very well, including the three central peaks.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Further on (x'~2-3H, Fig. 12b), the profile only has a double peak, with the maximum concentration at the peaks about twice that of the central minimum.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: This double-peaked profile arises as the original source is obscured and material at that point originates mostly from the two secondary sources.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Macdonald et al. (1998) reported similar double-peaked lateral profiles in their wind-tunnel experiments involving a release upstream of an aligned array of cubical obstacles.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Their measurements were within the array, and they attributed the double peaks to the bifurcation of the plume around an obstacle immediately downstream of the release, an interpretation supported by visualisation of the plume in a similarly-configured field experiment.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: In the present case, the profile is above the array and the double peaks cannot be explained simply by bifurcation around the cube; rather they are a consequence of the two strong secondary sources.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Still further from the source (x'~4H, Fig. 12c), as the two plumes widen they begin to merge and their superposition results in an approximately single-peaked profile.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: The shape of this lateral mean concentration profile therefore marks a transition region where the influence of the near-field distribution of sources begins to be smoothed out, but where the profile is still not quite Gaussian yet.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: This makes sense physically in terms of the superposition of plumes coming from the two secondary sources - far enough they appear so close together that they are approximately equivalent to a single effective source.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Owing to the generality of this argument, one would expect a similar behaviour in the far field for more complex building morphologies, for example with buildings of different heights - although the precise distance at which this occurs would likely depend on the details of the building arrangement, which determines the physical locations of the resulting secondary sources.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Sprawling Ending"}
{"text": "[Content]: So in the far field, which may be thus defined, the initial near-field source distribution does not matter; and a practical diagnostic of the far field might be construed in terms of the goodness of fit to a Gaussian (Goulart, 2012).\n[Classification]: Structured"}

{"text": "[Content]: Figs. 13-16 show concentration time series and computed statistics at different locations within and just above the aligned array for 0\u00c2\u00b0 and 45\u00c2\u00b0 flow.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: In these figures the location of each subplot corresponds to the actual location of the block that it pertains to, i.e. the distribution of subplots shows the actual layout of the array.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Indices i and j in the plot titles refer to the location of each block in the x and y directions respectively, starting from the lower left hand corner (i=1, j=1).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: So the sampling locations within the array (Figs. 13 and 15) are situated at z=0.5 H and those above the array (Figs. 14 and 16) are situated at z=1.5H.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The time series span a duration of 100T, over which are computed the mean concentration C (solid line), the root mean square fluctuating concentration crms (dash-dot line) and the relative fluctuation intensity I, defined as I=crms/C, in each of the blocks.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Coordination"}
{"text": "[Content]: In Fig. 13, the location of the source is in the block located at (i=4, j=7) and the mean wind is from left to right (0\u00c2\u00b0).\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The blocks immediately adjacent in the channels on either side also have high mean and r.m.s. concentrations, although not as high as in the source block.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Within the canyons directly downstream of the source (along the middle of the array in Fig. 13), C, crms and I are all smaller compared to their values in corresponding blocks in the adjacent channel.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: This is probably due to the combined effect of more efficient mixing in those canyons due to the canyon vortex and less exposure to larger scale eddies, which are more likely to be present in the channels where they might cause meandering of the plume and hence greater intermittency.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Sprawling Ending"}
{"text": "[Content]: In the top and bottom rows, the fluctuation intensity is quite high, however; this is because it is at the plume edge where the mean concentration is small in comparison to the fluctuations.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: Finally, we note the intermittent bursts in the concentration in the two blocks upstream of the release with correspondingly high fluctuation intensity of around 5 or greater.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: This is not unexpected: the flow above the array is exposed to larger scale fluctuations compared to the size of the plume, so that the plume above the array is more prone to meander.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Along the plume centreline the mean concentration decreases very slowly whereas the r.m.s. concentration decreases more rapidly, hence the rapid decrease in the fluctuation intensity.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Coordination"}
{"text": "[Content]: Hence, the maximum concentration at this height is not directly above the source block but one or two blocks downstream.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Inspection of Fig. 15 reveals a broadly similar picture for the 45\u00c2\u00b0 flow as in the 0\u00c2\u00b0 case, but with some notable differences.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Interestingly, we find that the largest value of mean concentration C is found not in the source cell (at least at that height) but in the two blocks immediately downstream in the x and y directions.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: However, crms is highest in the source block and so is the fluctuation intensity I, which has a value of around four there.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: As within the array, there is a general decrease in the values of C, crms and I with distance from the source.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: This is consistent with the picture that material released at the initial source location moves horizontally into the wake region of adjacent buildings where it is then pushed up by the updraft flow visualised in Section 3.1.3 and then spread by the faster flow above the array.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Sprawling Ending"}
{"text": "[Content]: As in the 0\u00c2\u00b0 flow, the fluctuation intensity I is larger than within the array; it generally decreases with distance from the source, except when the mean concentration C is very small.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: In this study we have analysed data from direct numerical simulations to document the effect of buildings on near-source dispersion for three case studies with different wind directions, building layout and source location.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: Secondly, trapping and re-release of material in the wakes of buildings in the immediate vicinity of the release gives rise to secondary sources.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: This appears to be a ubiquitous phenomenon, at least in the relatively high packing density regime investigated here, which is characteristic of city centres.\n[Classification]: Shapeless: Coordination"}
{"text": "[Content]: Without knowledge of these secondary sources, erroneous modelling assumptions might be made based purely on the initial location of the release.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 These near-field dispersion characteristics derive from the underlying flow structure around the buildings, which exerts a strong influence in the near field where there is a higher concentration of material.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
{"text": "[Content]: The detailed flow topology depends on the wind direction and building layout, but salient features such as diverging streamlines and wake recirculations are robust.\n[Classification]: NA"}
{"text": "[Content]: The three-dimensional structure of these flow features is especially pertinent and needs to be taken into account in models that aim to predict near-field concentrations.\n[Classification]: NA"}

{"text": "[Content]: Compared to the ligand, the positive cotton effect (CE) of complex 1 becomes weaker and narrower, which can be explained by the fact that the coordination of Co(II) to the nucleobase reduces the n\u00e2\u2020\u2019\u00cf\u20ac* transition of the chromophore [12] and the number of G4 is decreased [3].\n[Classification]: Structured"}

{"text": "[Content]: The strong negative CE centered at 297nm (\u00ce\u00b8\u00e2\u2030\u02c6-10mdeg) is due to the excitation coupling of \u00cf\u20ac\u00e2\u2020\u2019\u00cf\u20ac* transitions of the aromatic chromophores, including the intra- and intermolecular coupling of the guanine chromophores [13], which is consistent with the single crystal structure.\n[Classification]: Structured"}
